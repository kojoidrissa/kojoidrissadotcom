#What IS a developer?
2015-11-10
I'm currently having LOTS of thoughts about "being" a developer. Specifically, what it takes to get hired AS a developer BY other developers, if you haven't already BEEN a developer.

I'm not sure I'll **ever** be a "professional developer", using that definition. My only option may be to become a self-employed developer. Or, to be someone who develops as part of another role.
