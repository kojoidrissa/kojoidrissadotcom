**tl;dr: Go to St. James Park and walk the perimeter.**

I'm writing this mostly for [@webology](https://twitter.com/webology), who's in London at the moment. This is based on my spending ~8 hours in London on a layover from Houston to Hong Kong in 2007.

The key to this is St. James Park. A LOT of the most famous tourist attractions in London surround this park.

-  The northwest corner is dominated by the rear of Buckingham Palace. Due to time constraints, I only saw the rear.
-  The eastern edge of the park has, from south to north:
    -  Westminster Abbey
    -  Palace of Westminster: the home of the UK Parliament
    -  Big Ben
        -  Note: Big Ben is across the street from [Westminster tube station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_tube_station), which is on the Jubilee line and will take you directly to [London Bridge](https://goo.gl/maps/5VcyUB6HzZQ2).
    -  In this area, the [London Eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Eye) should also be visible, across the river.
    -  After passing Big Ben, continue north on Whitehall. 10 Downing Street (residence of the Prime Minister) is on your left
    -  [Great Scotland Yard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Scotland_Yard): While not as exciting as it once was, it's still a well-known name.
    -  Whitehall terminates at the northern end at [Charing Cross Tube Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charing_Cross_tube_station) & [Trafalgar Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafalgar_Square). Both the name and the visual of Trafalgar Square should be familiar to Harry Potter fans, if nothing else. Charing Cross will also [let you get to London Bridge](https://goo.gl/maps/czn4x4frLx42).

On the topic of [London Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Bridge), it's NOT that impressive to look at. The bridge most of us have seen on TV is [TOWER Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_Bridge), which is just EAST of London Bridge on the Thames.

That's all for THIS quick guide to tourist London. I was able to see all of this in under 8 hours, plus do some other stuff, plus get to and from Heathrow. So, this should be an easy day of site-seeing for all but the MOST time-sensitive.
