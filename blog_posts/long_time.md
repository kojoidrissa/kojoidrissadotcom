So, I came home from a [3D Printing meetup](http://www.meetup.com/TXRXLabs/events/225668502/) and figured out how to fix the issue with leading '0's in the RegEx I'm using for my [SMS-based Die Rolling project](https://github.com/kojoidrissa/helloflask).

So, that's good news. Now I can go to bed.

Also, there SHOULD be more good news to come!
