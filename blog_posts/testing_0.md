On 2015-12-01 I started a new role as a QA Specialist at [Decisio](http://decisiohealth.com/). That means I'm doing software testing. I've started working on a presentation for my [local Python user group/meetup](http://www.meetup.com/python-14/) I'm calling "Introduction to Software Testing".

I've decided to start sharing some of the ideas here, as a way to help me flesh them out. Look for them soon. :-)

It's not going to be anything groundbreaking, but I hope it will show people that testing is both helpful AND accessible to new programmers.
