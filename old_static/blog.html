        <p>I'm starting this blog at the time stamp above. It's part of my 2nd 30 day Github challenge. Specifically, the HTML/CSS/JS part. Though I may only spend a week on HTML/CSS, then another on JS. I also want to try to squeeze in as much DB and Django work as I can, along with more Python. We'll see how that works out, timing wise.
        </p>

        <p>I'm already realizing I need some sort of structure here. I guess I'll work that out tomorrow. Now, it's time for bed. <span lang = "zh-hant">晚安好夢</span>.
        </p>

        <p>PS: Syntax highlighting is NOT as helpful when you've got <a href = "https://justgetflux.com/">Flux</a> running and it's late. :-/ This is a failed emoji: &#x1F612;

        <h2>2014-11-25T12:32:17-06:00</h2>
        <p>Played with the Lanugage attribute in HTML a little today. I'll get a lot of use out of that, as I tend to mix various Asian languages into what I write.
        </p>

        <p>New Ideas
            <ul>
                <li>create CSS to give each different day of this "blog" a different style</li>
                <li>Can I write JavaScript that will take the ISO timestamp I'm using and transform it into different date formats?</li>
                <li>can I use the timestamp to determine which entries get different styling? Detect the date and apply the differing styles based on that information?</li>
                <li>I wonder if the Arrow library in Python would let me transform the timestamp?</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>I probably <del>won't</del> <ins>will</ins> use the Insert and Delete tags</p>

        <p>Not much today, going to bed early. But, I'll include a link to the <a href = "#start">start</a> of this blog.</p>

        <h2>2014-11-27T23:42:16-06:00</h2>
        <p>Happy Thanksgiving!</p>

        <h2>2014-11-28T22:33:50-06:00</h2>
        <p>I did nothing, but needed to make a commit. So ashamed. :-(</p>

        <h2>2014-11-29T23:52:44-06:00</h2>
        <p>I'm adding an image.</p>
            <img src = "images/shepherd_bridge.jpg" alt = "Shepherd Drive pedestrian bridge over Buffalo Bayou" title = "Shepherd Bridge over Buffalo Bayou, looking north at the American General campus" width = 90% height = 90% />

        <h2>2014-11-30T21:16:53-06:00</h2>
        <p>Now I'm reusing the same image, but with the &lt;figure&gt; tags</p>
        <figure>
            <img src = "images/shepherd_bridge.jpg" alt = "Shepherd Drive pedestrian bridge over Buffalo Bayou" title = "Shepherd Bridge over Buffalo Bayou, looking north at the American General campus" width = 90% height = 90% />
            <br />
            <figcaption>This  is the American General building, seen from the Shepherd  pedestrian bridge near sunlight.

        <h2>2014-12-03T12:50:37-06:00</h2>
        <p>I've been working on my <a href = "https://github.com/kojoidrissa/random_30Day_code/blob/master/anonymize.py">anonymization code</a>. It seems to be working as expected. I'll probably break it out into a separate repo at some point, now that I know it's functional. But I've still got some design work to do on it to make it actually USEFUL.
        </p>

        <h2>2014-12-05T16:31:09-06:00</h2>
        <p>A little more progress on the anonymizer code. It'll show "%unique" among data that's been anonymized. I also found out that my Rackspace battery pack <em>will</em> power my Raspberry Pi!</p>

        <h2>2014-12-06T16:10:40-06:00</h2>
        <p>I'm at <a href = "http://www.meetup.com/Girls-Coding-Club/events/204344922/">Girls Coding Club</a>, getting my code on. I need to work on the Django tutorial more, so I can get <a href = "http://kojoidrissa.com">my personal site</a> up and running ASAP.
        </p>

        <h2>2014-12-07T21:14:41-06:00</h2>
        <p>Today was a day of little coding but lots of planning. Now, to see how those plans turn out! <b>#foreshadowing</b>
        </p>

        <h2>2014-12-08T12:27:41-06:00</h2>
        <p>Today, we play with FORMS!</p>

        <p>The <code>form</code> element,  &lt;form&gt; requires an <code>action</code> attribute and <em>should</em> have a <code>method</code> and <code>id</code> attribute.
        </p>

        <p>The <code>method</code> attribute will be <code>get</code> or <code>put</code>. It defaults to <code>get</code> if no method is specified (although it's best to give one). The <code>id</code> attribute behaves like it does in other elements.
        </p>

        <form action="http://www.example.com/subscribe.php" method="get">
            <p>This is where the form controls will appear. Or, <b>would</b>, if we used an <code>input</code> element to provide them
            </p>

            <p>Username:
                <input type="text" name="username" size="15" maxlength="30" />
            </p>
        </form>

        <p>Each form control (created by the <code>input</code> element) requires a name attribute, to identify the data being entered. The <code>type</code> attribute determines what KIND of form control is used.  The <code>size</code> attribute is depricated, with CSS handling those duties now. <code>maxlength</code> is used to control the length of the data being entered.
        </p>

        <p>The <code>textarea</code> element creates a multi-line area to enter text. This element needs an opening and closing tag, unlike other input elements, which are 'empty'. You should use CSS to control the size of a <code>textarea</code> control.
        </p>

        <h3>Various input types and their controls</h3>
        <p>These take the form <code> &lt;input type="TYPENAME" /&gt;</code> in your HTML.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>text</code>: single-line text field</li>
            <li><code>password</code>: as above, but with the entered characters hidden. They're only hidden from view, not secured or encrypted.</li>
            <li><code>radio</code>: allows users to choose 1 and ONLY 1 of multiple options</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The <code>name</code> attribute names the type of question being asked. All questions of the same category should share the same name attribute.</li>
                <li>The <code>value</code> attribute tells the server which answer has been selected. The value for every radio button should be unique w/in a group of questions
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li><code>checkbox</code>: allows users to choose more than one answer. The <code>name</code> and <code>value</code> attributes</li> function as with the radio type above.

        </ul>

        <h2>2014-12-10T18:58:12-06:00</h2>
        <p>Not much activity today. Had lunch with Lauren on her last day before maternity leave. Yay babies!  I need to finish the Forms chapter tomorrow.</p>

        <h2>2014-12-13T23:07:34-06:00</h2>
        <p>Most of my 'productive' time was spent testing Minecraft on my current RasPi and getting the SD card set up for my new one. Also, the LONG process of `apt-get dist-upgrade`, that I had to leave running overnight. I need to order Rio's stuff tomorrow.</p>

        <p>I also need to write at least a little bit of Minecraft-Pi code to share at the <a href ="http://www.meetup.com/Houston-Recreational-Computer-Programming-Group/">Recreational Programmers Meetup</a> tomorrow. I can use the <a href = "http://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/getting-started-with-minecraft-pi/worksheet.md">worksheet</a> as a starting point. But what will I make that's interesting?</p>

        <h2>2014-12-14T21:32:18-06:00</h2>
        <p>The `apt-get dist-upgrade` I left running last night, was STILL going when I checked it around 3pm today. Only at 85%. The Wolfram Engine had downloaded more than 1,500 packages. :-/
        </p>

        <h2>2014-12-15T19:50:33-06:00</h2>
        <p>Buying most of my daughter's RasPi stuff from <a href = "https://www.adafruit.com/">Adafruit</a>. I hope it'll get here soon.</p>
        
        <h2>2014-12-24T20:15:13-06:00</h2>
        <p>Christmas Eve! Hadn't realized I've neglected my blog for so long. Well, big changes are on the way! More on that later.</p>

        <h2>2014-12-28T19:16:45-06:00</h2>
        <p>A day of fairly low productivity. But I DID learn a lot more about 3D printing. And made my first print. So, there's that.</p>

        <h2>2014-12-29T21:34:47-06:00</h2>
        <p>Semi-productive day today. Got some exercise in.  But, the big changes start soon.</p>

        <h2>2015-01-01T00:36:27-06:00</h2>
        <p>HAPPY NEW YEAR!!</p>
        <p>A new year and a new career as a software engineer. Time to make things happen!</p>

        <p>I need to spend some time planning out software projects I'm going to
            <ol>
                <li>Build (including web sites)</li>
                <li>Use (what CAD software will I use for 2 & 3D design and 3D Printing? What graphics software will I use?)</li>
                <li>Contribute to (which FLOSS project am I going to start contributing to? Python? Django? OpenPyXL? One of the options from above?)</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Also! Starting my Code Push challenge NOW! Can I do all 365 days of 2015?!? So, there's a LOT to do this year!
        </p>

        <h2>2015-01-05T21:27:12-06:00</h2>
        <p>The end is near. So is a new beginning.</p>
